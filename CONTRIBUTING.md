# Contributing Feedback

Thank you for helping improve Favorize! Here's how to write useful feedback.

## Bug Reports

A good bug report includes:
- **What happened** — describe the unexpected behavior
- **What you expected** — what should have happened instead
- **Steps to reproduce** — how can we trigger the same bug?
- **Device and OS** — e.g., "iPhone 15, iOS 18" or "Pixel 8, Android 15"
- **App version** — found in Account > Settings > About
- **Screenshots or screen recordings** — if the issue is visual

## Feature Requests

A good feature request includes:
- **The problem** — what are you trying to do that's hard or impossible?
- **Your idea** — how would you like it to work?
- **Alternatives** — have you tried other ways to solve this?

## General Tips

- Check if someone already reported the same thing — add a thumbs up instead of a duplicate
- Stay on topic — one issue per report
- Be patient — we read everything, but may not respond immediately
